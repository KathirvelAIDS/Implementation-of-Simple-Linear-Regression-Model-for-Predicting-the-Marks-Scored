# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Step 1:
Use the standard libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot in python for the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.

Step 2:
Set variables for assigning dataset values and implement the .iloc module for slicing the values of the variables X and y.

Step 3:
Import the following modules for linear regression; from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split and also from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression.

Step 4:
Assign the points for representing the points required for the fitting of the straight line in the graph.

Step 5:
Predict the regression of the straight line for marks by using the representation of the graph.

Step 6:
Compare the graphs (Training set, Testing set) and hence we obtained the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored using the given datas.

Step 7:
End the program.
